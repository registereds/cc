To initiate the password reset process for your

<?php echo $email; ?> <?php echo sfConfig::get('app_site_name'); ?> Account, click the link below:

http://www.<?php echo sfConfig::get('app_site_domain'); ?>/account/pr?c=<?php echo $hash; ?>


If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL in a
new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you
didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can
safely disregard this email.

Thank you for using <?php echo sfConfig::get('app_site_name'); ?>.
